AngouPixel is an open source pixel font designed by [@0xLuo](https://twitter.com/0xLuo) using [Glyphs3](https://glyphsapp.com/).

"Angou" means "暗号" in Japanese. This pixel font uses 3x5 dot matrix (some smaller or larger) and covers English letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and common punctuation marks. (Some special English symbols are waiting for you to discover.)

Welcome everyone to use it anywhere. Let me know if you want me to update some symbols.
